# Amazon Reviews Database Design

This repository contains code generated and analyzed for my MSDS 420 Database Systems course.

It includes:

- **PostgreSQL** queries for structured analytics over an Amazon product reviews dataset.
- **Elasticsearch** queries for keyword, fuzzy, and proximity text search.
- **Milvus** (vector database) queries for semantic similarity search over review embeddings.

All code in `queries/` comes from Requirement 4 of the project:
"Use ChatGPT to generate code for every query using the recommended database."
